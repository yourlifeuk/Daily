# Planning and Network Design
**< specification of client, requirment and the network, Port-count, throughput, bandwidth, security, segmentation, resilience, routing comlexities,   >**

During the planning and design phases we consider the specific challenges and requirements of both the network and the client – including port-count, throughput, bandwidth, security, segmentation, resilience, routing complexities, and application specific requirements.

These are all key considerations for any network deployment irrespective of size or vendor.

We design networks ranging from a single switch with a couple of VLANs right through to multi-campus complex layer-3 architectures with RADIUS / 802.1x authentication and fully resilient core and distribution layers. We have designed networks that occupy a single room, and we have designed networks that quite literally span the globe, but most importantly we design networks that fulfil and exceed our customers’ requirements.

Although we work predominantly with our preferred manufacturers Cisco, Meraki, Aruba and Unifi, we pride ourselves on being vendor agnostic so can often respond to bespoke and unusual requests and can always provide a solution that meets both the technical and financial requirements.

Clients can rest-assured that we guarantee our designs, we provide comprehensive reports and design documentation, and we continue the project and relationship into the installation and commissioning phases.


# Configuration and Installation
<Mainly it is about Flexnet is providing supply & fit services (including router, swtich, wirelss), They have professional engineer to install and configure those devices, also Had lead network enginner to inspect the work, he will act as supervious role>, 

Our preferred approach is to complete the majority of the configuration and testing offsite within our controlled lab environment.

This allows us to resolve any hardware issues prior to attending site, complete the configuration more efficiently, and to keep costly onsite attendance to a minimum. Following offsite configuration and testing the equipment can be available for client testing if so desired prior to taking it to site.

Whether the network is being installed within a new or existing site, our trusted and skilled in-house installation engineers work under the expert guidance of our technical engineers to facilitate the installation of the equipment within the customers’ comms cabinets. If migrating from old equipment to new our engineers will methodically remove existing patching, creating detailed documentation as they go, before installing and connecting the new equipment. Our installation engineers working in conjunction with our technical engineers helps to minimise any network downtime experienced by the client, while completing a neat and tidy job.

Where clients often have to instruct one company to complete the switching and routing work, then another to complete the installation, cabling and patching, we pride ourselves on completing the project as a whole. Not only does this make the installation more coordinated and efficient, this gives the client a single party to deal with and allows us to ensure quality and conformance is maintained throughout all aspects of the solution.

# Commissioning, Testing and Handover
 < Basicly the testing and handover, they willl do it together will client, client may has questions. Also it will be not so techincal, Client doesn't need to be professional to go through those details. >,

Following successful installation and connectivity of network hardware our technical engineers begin the Commissioning and Testing phases which are often completed hand-in-hand with the client.

We actively encourage client involvement at this stage as it helps to introduce the new solution and allows the client to complete testing of their own whilst our engineers are on site.

In some instances, testing is a fairly simple exercise, and in others it can be a very complex and time-consuming process, but either way testing is a critical component of the overall solution. It’s an element that is often rushed or overlooked and this can lead to issues post-completion.

As we complete testing with our clients (as much as possible) this also doubles-up as a demonstration and handover activity. Whilst comprehensive documentation is provided following the successful deployment, there’s nothing quite like having the experts show you over your shiny new network (over a cup of coffee or two)!


# Before you learning
 * need to ask yourself, what is the result you will going to have
 * What are you looking for 
 * what do you want to achieve
 * how can it apply to me and how can it help me

# while you learning
 * Assosication & hangers , using story/ pictures stick into your brain
 * visualizing the image in your mind, alway repeat to yourself
 * 

# Research
 * looking for solution, not a defintion 

 week 1 go through 
 week 2 go through another vendor
 week 3 need to do research/ book
 week 4 Only doing Labs
 week 5 critical thinking,  go thorugh note and questions
 week 6 question and question the lab
 week 7
